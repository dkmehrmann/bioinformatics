# data_steps.R

Reads in the GSE file and creates training and test files for the original analysis. Drops 3 observations for NA values and quite a few predictors not present in all samples. Then we normalize the data according to the paper.

# EDA.R

Gets general information about the data from the original analysis, mostly to ensure our data looks the same as that used in the paper.

# reproduce.R

Attempted to reproduce the paper results and found a problem with the data such that we can only reproduce the results on the test set.

# analyses.R

The meat of this paper, currently implements Naive Bayes, Thresholded Naive Bayes, and LASSO
